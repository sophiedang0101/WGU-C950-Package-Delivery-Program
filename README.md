# WGU-C950-Package-Delivery-Program
This Python program with a CLI interface simulates an efficient mail truck delivery route between three trucks and two drivers. It uses the Nearest Neighbor algorithm to calculate and establish an optimized route, reducing three trucksâ€™ distance to 103.0 miles, enabling the delivery of an average of 40 packages in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah in a day.
A chaining hash table was used to ensure rapid and efficient O (1) time complexity for operations including searching, inserting, storing, and retrieving package details.
